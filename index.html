    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        In this portfolio I included the projects that I created for the Udemy BootCamp <b>"The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"</b> by Angela Yu. I added some extra projects that I created for my own practice. I also added the links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

    <h2>Eduaction</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm a student of the Autonomus University of Morelos State (UAEM) in Mexico. I'm studying the degree of Physics. I'm in my last year of the degree.</li>
            <li>I had a technical degree as a profetional technician bachelor in informatics from CONALEP Cuautla.</li>
            <li>I completed the BootCamp "HTML5 and CSS3 Fundamentals".</li>
            <li>I'm currently enrolled in the "The Complete C Programming Bootcamp"</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
        As a student in UAEM, I made a few projects using Pthon, C and Mathematica. In my thesis I used Python and C to compute the values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the espectral index in the inflationary model of the universe. I also used Mathematica to plot the results. The results were published in the journal "Physical Review D" in the article "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.083015">New generalization of the simplest &alpha;-attractor T model</a>" and under the direction by my thesis director, the Ph.D. Gabriel Germán Velarde.
